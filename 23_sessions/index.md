## Outline

-   Sessions are forgotten when the server restarts
    -   But cookie persists, which is confusing
-   [`server_sessions.py`](./server_sessions.py) stores  session ID in database
    -   When the user logs in, create a new session and store the session ID as a cookie
    -   When the user makes a request, check if the session ID in the cookie matches the session ID in the database
    -   Create a `sessions` table in the database to store session IDs and corresponding user IDs
    -   Add `create_session`, `get_session`, and `delete_session` to [`models.py`](./models.py)
- JSON Web Tokens [JWT][jwt] are an alternative to session-based authentication
    -   Lightweight JSON-based authentication mechanism
    -   Encode and sign user claims as JSON
    -   Client stores the resulting token and returns it with subsequent requests
    -   Use [jwt.io][jwt-io] to generate, decode, and verify tokens
- JWT-based authentication implemented in [`server_secure_jwt.py`](./server_secure_jwt.py)
    -   Uses `pyjwt` library
    -   Generates a token upon successful login, storing staff ID and expiration time
    -   Token _should_ be set as an HTTP-only cookie for security
    -   When a cookie is marked this way,
        JavaScript can no longer access the cookie using `document.cookie`
    -   Prevents [cross-site scripting](g:xss) (XSS) attacks)
-   Protected routes (like `/exp/<staff_id>`) verify the JWT before granting access
    -   Provides stateless authentication, improving scalability
        -   JWTs are stateless, meaning the server doesn't need to store session information
        -   This reduces server memory usage and makes scaling easier
    -   Handles token expiration and invalid tokens
    -   Uses environment variables for JWT secret
    -   Once authenticated, you will see the cookie value
    -   Check it in [jwt.io][jwt-io]
