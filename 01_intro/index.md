# Introduction

<p id="terms"></p>

-   Sooner or later you're going to want to share your findings
-   And learning how the web works is fun
-   Use modern Python and JavaScript tools
    -   Yes, you're going to have to learn some JavaScript…
    -   …but it's not as bad as you've been told

## Setup

-   Install [uv][uv] for managing Python packages and [virtual environments](g:virtual-env) and then run:
    -   `uv venv` in the root directory of this project to create a virtual environment in `./.venv`
    -   `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate that virtual environment
    -   `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml` to install requirements
-   To regenerate the sample data, run `make datasets` to:
    -   install the default parameters for `snailz` in `./params`, and
    -   regenerate the sample data in `./data`
    -   We use [Make][make] to run tasks because every other option proved to be more complicated
-   Project uses [McCole][mccole] to generate and check HTML
    -   Run `make render` to regenerate the HTML in `./docs` from the Markdown files
    -   Run `make lint` at any time to check the state of the project

## The Data

[snailz][snailz] creates synthetic data for a study of mutant snails in the Pacific Northwest.

-   One or more *surveys* are conducted at one or more *sites*.
-   Each survey collects *genomes* and *sizes* of snails.
-   A *grid* at each site is marked out to show the presence or absence of pollution.
-   *Staff* perform *assays* of the snails' genetic material.
-   Each assay plate has a *design* showing the material applied and *readings* showing the measured response.
-   Plates may be *invalidated* after the fact if a staff member believes it is contaminated.
